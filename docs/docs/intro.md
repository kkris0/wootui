# Introduction

Welcome to **WooTUI** - a powerful terminal user interface for translating WooCommerce products using AI.

## What is WooTUI?

WooTUI is a command-line application that automates the translation of WooCommerce product catalogs into multiple languages using Google's Gemini AI. It integrates seamlessly with the WordPress Multilingual Plugin (WPML) to provide a complete translation workflow.

### Why WooTUI?

**Speed & Efficiency**

- Translate entire product catalogs in minutes, not hours
- Batch processing for handling large inventories
- Cost-effective AI translations with transparent pricing

**Accuracy & Quality**

- Context-aware translations using Google Gemini
- Preserves HTML formatting and special characters
- Maintains brand consistency across languages

**Control & Flexibility**

- Choose which columns to translate (descriptions, attributes, SEO meta)
- Override or skip existing translations
- Preview costs before executing translations

**Terminal-First Design**

- Fast, keyboard-driven interface
- Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- No browser required—runs entirely in your terminal

## Key Features

🤖 **AI-Powered Translation** - Uses Google Gemini for accurate, context-aware translations

🌍 **Multi-Language Support** - Translate to any target language supported by Gemini

💰 **Cost Transparency** - See token usage and pricing estimates before translating

📦 **WooCommerce CSV Compatible** - Works directly with WooCommerce product exports

✅ **Column Selection** - Choose which columns to translate for maximum control

⌨️ **Terminal UI** - Fast, efficient interface built with OpenTUI

## How It Works

WooTUI guides you through a simple 6-step wizard:

1. **CSV Path** - Select your WooCommerce export file
2. **Column Selection** - Choose which fields to translate
3. **Target Languages** - Select languages and override settings
4. **Cost Estimation** - Preview token usage and costs
5. **Translation** - Execute translations via Gemini API
6. **Results** - View summary and download translated CSV

The translated CSV file is ready to import back into WooCommerce with WPML, preserving all translation groups and metadata.
