## API Key Security

### Do

- ✅ Keep API key private
- ✅ Store securely (WooTUI config file is local only)
- ✅ Regenerate key if compromised

### Don't

- ❌ Share key publicly
- ❌ Commit key to GitHub
- ❌ Use same key across multiple apps (create separate keys)

---

## Free Tier

Google Gemini offers a **free tier** with generous limits:

- 15 requests per minute
- Enough for small-medium catalogs

**Typical usage**:

- 100 products ≈ 20 requests (with batch size 5)
- Translation time ≈ 2-3 minutes

**When to upgrade**: If you hit rate limits frequently or need faster processing for large catalogs (1000+ products).

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

**Solution**:

1. Verify key starts with `AIza` and has no extra spaces
2. Check key is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure Gemini API is enabled for your project

### "Quota Exceeded" Error

**Solution**:

- Wait 1 minute and retry
- Reduce batch size to 3-5
- Upgrade to paid tier in Google Cloud Console
